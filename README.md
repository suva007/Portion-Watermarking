SECURITY ENHANCEMENT USING COMBINED DCT-DWT DIGITAL IMAGE WATERMARKING TECHNIQUE

The snowballing of digitisation due to rapid growth in internet and computer technologies , image authentication and image restoration in case of any attack is one of the major factors in todayâ€™s environment. Digital watermarking is one such saviour that has been developed to protect digital images from illegal manipulations. A combined approach of DCT-DWT based image watermarking is put forward in this paper that effectively enhances the image restoration and authentication capability.
In this scheme the cover image is sliced into 9 * 9 non - overlapping blocks and each block is then fed into fragile watermarking module based on combination of DCT - DWT and the watermarked image is further made over before transmission over the network in order to enhance security capabilities and making it impalpable for the attacker.
The restoration is achievable with high PSNR of 67.2% for each non-overlapping block and 100% in case of full watermarked image.
Evaluating the results of this approach tells the two transforms with this new approach of self-embedding enhances the performance and security with great extent.
